7. **Open Anyway**

   ![Security open anyway](../images/OpenAnyway.png){: width="500"}

8. **Really Open Anyway** Now tell the **Finder** that it's OK to open it! (Don't Move to Trash!)

{: .note }

> These shenanigans are required required the first time because the app is not code-signed. After the first launch, you can open it normally. I have spent the $100 to register as an Apple Developer; I estimate that it'll take about another $1000 worth of my time to figure out how to accomplish that.
