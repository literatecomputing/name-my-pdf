## 📖 How It Works

NameMyPdf scans your PDF files for DOI (Digital Object Identifier) information, queries the CrossRef API for metadata, and renames your files in a clean, standardized format.

**Before:**

```
downloaded-paper.pdf
arxiv-1234.5678v2.pdf
```

**After:**

```
Smith 2023 - Machine Learning Applications.pdf
Johnson 2024 - Neural Network Architecture.pdf
```
